# Lettuce Click

A whimsical React Native clicker game where you grow a lettuce-powered garden. Tap the lettuce emoji to earn clicks, unlock automatic speed upgrades, and decorate your white-space garden with plant emojis.

## Getting started

This project is built with the Expo managed workflow. If you do not have the Expo CLI installed globally, you can run it with `npx`.

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

The Expo CLI will let you open the app on web, iOS, or Android. For the web experience, press `w` after the bundler starts.

## Game rules

* Manual taps on the lettuce button award one click.
* Automatic helpers unlocked through upgrades add clicks for you in 0.1 second intervals.
* Upgrades become available at total click milestones (10 through 1,000,000,000) and permanently increase your automatic clicks per second.
* Spend clicks on plant emojis to decorate your garden grid.

Happy clicking!
